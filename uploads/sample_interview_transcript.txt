          00:01
          foreign [Music] okay so shall we start yeah it's okay so Baba can you give me a small introduction about yourself thank you for the opportunity uh my name ishwar and I've done my b-tech from computer science branch I got 7.8 cgp in my colleges and I got a 78 in my 12th standard regarding technical skills computer science is present in every field as everyone knows so I spent the last four years owning my Technical and software skills in computer science I've learned programming in Java C C plus plus

          
          00:51
          JavaScript which I'm learning right now I've learned database Technologies like SQL MySQL mongodb I've created some projects like Library management quiz app and calculator and there are other small projects that are made I think that they're in my CV actually you can find the GitHub links for those there are small small projects are there as well apart from that I think what has helped me the most is participating in a lot of hackathons both online and offline they really helped me to you know be aware of what

          
          01:22
          my peers are learning and kind of kept me ahead of the curve so that I can keep myself updated with technology and apart from technical skills regarding personal life I have few Hobbies I love to play football I love reading as well and I love watching science fiction movies so they think that wraps up everything about me okay okay so my next question is what are your long-term goals uh my long-term goals would be to gain as much experience as I can in my domain that is additionally I plan on what I

          
          01:59
          learned using these initial formative years from a uh for my next few years which can help me move into a more senior position so uh using previous expense will help me so that when opportunities come for promotions or any other opportunities come then I can make use of it if I use the correct skills as such having a long-term Vision in while starting out a career in corporate can be very helpful so that you can apply yourself in the right direction and be aligned with that plan I think that's my long-term goal as of

          
          02:32
          now at least okay good can you state the difference between hard work and smart work I really both are necessary in a person one person needs to understand how when to use Smart work and when to use hard work uh but I think uh what really differentiates is using less resources and less time to achieve the same result by putting more effort in high yielding activities rather than mindlessly slaving away I think that's what makes the distinction between hard work and smart work uh more prominent it's like uh I think there's a quote by

          
          03:04
          Steve Jobs or some uh no I'm sorry that that quote is from Bill Gates where he said that I will find a lazy person to do a difficult job because he'll find an easy way to do it so I think that pretty much sums it up the difference between hard and smart work okay good very good uh now let's start with the technical questions sure first treat yourself in Java out of 10. uh I think I rate myself for 6.5 out of 10 in Java okay okay good now tell me what are jdk jvm and JRE please explain about them

          
          03:37
          sure let me go one by one first would be the GDK which is the Java development kit software package of jvm and Jr it contains both it jdk basically provides the standard edition of the Java application programming interface second was jvm which is the Java virtual machine it's basically converts the program into bytecode which basically means it converts a user-friendly syntax to machine language that the machine can Java machine and The Interpreter can understand okay third one would be the JRE which is the

          
          04:10
          Java runtime environment and provides the libraries and the resources for jdk to execute the Java programs I think that's the main distinction between these three yeah right right so uh can you tell me does Java include pointers um no Java does not include pointers can you just please explain okay so basically the first point of pointers are the main benefit I would say would be to uh for uh taking a memory allocation purposes so Java already has jvm like you mentioned before so jvm automatically takes care

          
          04:43
          of memory allocation so there is no real-time use case as such and when it comes to a side benefits or pointers uh like uh clearing memory because it just points to a specific memory for clearing memory Java also has this garbage collector so all in all there is no particular use case in majority of the cases in Java where we would actually require a pointer that is not something already being done by Java right itself okay so you are saying Java does not use pointer in real time programming right

          
          05:12
          correct whatever all those benefits or pointers that they offer in C Java takes care of it on its own okay okay good uh list some Java 8 date and time apis I think the Three core apis would be the local date local time and local date time okay uh what is the default method and when does it get used the default method actually involves an implementation and it is found in an interface the method adds new functionalities to an interface while preserving backward compiler backward compatibility with the classes

          
          05:47
          that have already implemented that particular interface I think that's a main purpose of our default method in general okay okay uh okay can you mention the main classes implementing the list interface first I think the most important will be the linked list which basically linked elements with no index and arraylist which can be indexed then Vector which is similar to array in some aspects and it also can be indexed and the fourth would be a stack stack which follows the last in first dot methodology of the of

          
          06:21
          data structure okay you just said array can you explain what is an array array can be referred to as a collection of items which are stored in a continuous memory locations it's it must contain items of the same data type when it organizes data in a related set of values that can easily be sorted searched manipulated Etc so basically it helps create a collection of similarly uh defined variables uh values in a single array variable okay so we cannot store any other data types in Array right yeah all

          
          06:59
          elements must be of the same data type there cannot be any mix and match okay okay good can you explain what is in linked list it's kind of similar to array but it refers to linear data structure in which the elements are not necessarily stored in a continuous manner like they are stored in an array so it's basically a sequence of nodes with each node pointing towards the next node then that's how it forms a chain-like structure that's how it's different from an array okay mention the link list

          
          07:28
          supported by Java a Java supports to a singly linked list and W linked list single linked lists where each node points to uh stores the data and references to the next node whereas the W linked list has points to two different ones which is the one before it and the one after it these are the only two that are the job okay good uh can you tell me what is regretation what is recursion you must have read about this yes uh recursion would refer to a function calling itself under a particular terminating condition follows

          
          08:01
          the last in first out methodology and it makes use of the stack uh data structure okay now please tell me which sorting algorithm is best according to you uh I don't think any sorting algorithm can be considered the best okay there are many like bubble sort selection sort balloons or Radix or all those things are there but I don't think we can turn any one of them as the best because they all have different use cases if the if there would have been a single best sorting algorithm all of us would be

          
          08:31
          using only that one right so I don't think there's particular best they are fit for the specific type of data structures where it performs the most efficiently so no I don't think there is particularly in my opinion I don't know the best sorting algorithm okay right uh what is the difference between system dot out system.e Double R and system.in to error can you just explain about it yes uh system dot out and system.err represent the monitor by default and this can be used to send data or results

          
          09:07
          to the monitor so system.out specifically is used to display normal messages and results basically the print function of the Java family system.err is used to display the error messages and setup.in third refers the input string which uh is saying pushing object actually which by default represents standard input device which in almost 99 of the cases is a keyboard okay now can you write down the syntax on how to create a linked list and a vector in Java you can just type it in the chat box uh sure

          
          09:47
          I'll actually create a new object okay author linked list class here yeah [Music] I just want to see the logic only okay okay uh this is to create only the object variable for the linked list I know actually uh [Music] okay [Music] it's quite similar to the link list object but we have to add two more parameters which would be the size and increment okay let's type it here only I think I have shared okay okay fine so my next question is how do you get the highest number that exists on a list just write a code here only okay should

          
          10:53
          I just put a sample uh yeah yeah I just want to see the approach you are using sure okay I'll just write the code again highest number that exists on a list you can take any random list I'll create a list with integer value [Music] foreign foreign list okay foreign yes okay I think that should be enough like should I elaborate more or do you think it's yeah it's fine it's fine I just wanted to see the approach that you're using okay now can you write how to do the reverse in string in Java reversing a string right yeah okay

          
          13:11
          you can just take a string hello and just reverse it okay I'll put it in a variable [Music] I'll create a dummy variable named reverse where the actual reversed output will be stored first I'll take the length of the string and store it in the length variable like I just shared next I'll start a for Loop uh there's a single line in the body I'll just write that down separately okay so you are taking basically it's taking all the elements and it will keep adding them to the reverse variable that I had declared

          
          14:13
          before and the next step would be to just print out the final reverse variable I think that will reverse the string completely okay okay fine now how many objects will be inside the hash map um there can be two elements with the same hash code but when two elements have the same hash code Java uses the equals to further differentiate so there can be one or two objects depending on the content of the objects yeah okay okay now give an example how to create a hash map in the chat only okay so like a sample

          
          15:05
          yeah okay sure I'll first import the necessary libraries this is the hashmap library then I will report the mapping Library I'll start the main function okay the class declaration um now I would go with [Music] and now I'll start the body of the main function if you need time to just think of the approach you can take time with this which I thank you so much um I'll be putting two string values declaring a new hash map right now hmm [Music] [Music] uh declare the new initialize the new hash map then I'll start storing data in

          
          16:28
          these hashmaps using the put function this would be the first element and next would be similarly I'll put another element just to show okay you're taking the car names okay so I've already just put two in the hash map so now I can I can keep adding more but I think if I just adding I can just talk just add two or three only yeah so these two are done so I can just print out as obj and just basically close the main function that's it I think this will okay just let me read once it's good okay can you please tell me what are

          
          18:01
          your greatest strength and weaknesses okay I'll start with my strengths I think my ability to work well in a team is one of my finest assets I have a strong sense of self-motivation and I'm a very quick learner whatever assignment I get I usually uh I tend to finish it very diligently and preferably ahead of schedule I don't know if there are any standout weaknesses as such but one thing that I believe can be improved about myself I'm a people skills indulging in conversation with co-workers and people

          
          18:32
          I'm not very comfortable with or talk regularly with but I have been working on that a lot and there has been a lot of progress and there is going to be more for sure moving on I think that's the only thing that I can count as a weakness okay good uh so where do you see yourself in five years okay uh I think initially I would first uh like to grow my skills as a team player in the first few years at any organization uh then understanding how upper level management works and then ultimately uh get up earn a managerial

          
          19:06
          position most likely handling a very high output team and being able to Mentor a bright group of people who who are prepping for their next step in their career just like I would have done by them now tell me why should we hire you uh have a very strong sense of motivation I really push myself to improve and learn more I am very open-minded as well and I pick things up rather quickly like to solve difficulties and hopefully solve roadblocks for our teammates come as me okay apart from that from apart from

          
          19:39
          spills perspective additionally I believe that the values of this organization and mind are very compatible so that's why I think I believe that this job in this position will support my interests and present me with enough engaging and exciting opportunities that will help me advance myself and the company so that's why frankly I'm very excited about this chance okay okay good okay so thank you baba this is all from my side if you have any questions you can ask me I think uh I really have only one

          
          20:12
          question uh can you tell me about a company and the more importantly the daily responsibility is that I'll be you know asked to ahead on a day-to-day basis okay so wherever right now I can't tell you everything but we are a software company we develop software according to the needs of the clients and everyone is Young and energetic here so the environment is also very good okay I think that's all I needed to know okay okay thank you so much for your interest we'll let you know the results very soon

          
          20:43
          okay so thank you so much I will definitely look forward to hearing okay hi there if you like this video subscribe to the simply learn YouTube channel and click here to watch similar videos turn it up and get certified click here
