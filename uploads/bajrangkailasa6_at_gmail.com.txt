Java Mock Interview for Freshers
0:01
foreign
0:10
[Music]
0:15
okay so shall we start
0:17
yeah it's okay so Baba can you give me a
Introduction
0:21
small introduction about yourself
0:23
thank you for the opportunity uh my name
0:27
ishwar and I've done my b-tech from
0:29
computer science branch I got 7.8 cgp in
0:33
my colleges and I got a 78 in my 12th
0:37
standard
0:38
regarding technical skills computer
0:40
science is present in every field as
0:42
everyone knows so I spent the last four
0:44
years owning my Technical and software
0:46
skills in computer science I've learned
0:48
programming in Java C C plus plus
0:51
JavaScript which I'm learning right now
0:53
I've learned database Technologies like
0:55
SQL MySQL mongodb I've created some
0:58
projects like Library management quiz
1:00
app and calculator and there are other
1:03
small projects that are made I think
1:05
that they're in my CV actually you can
1:07
find the GitHub links for those there
1:08
are small small projects are there as
1:10
well apart from that I think what has
1:12
helped me the most is participating in a
1:15
lot of hackathons
1:16
both online and offline they really
1:19
helped me to you know be aware of what
1:22
my peers are learning and kind of kept
1:24
me ahead of the curve so that I can keep
1:26
myself updated with technology and apart
1:29
from technical skills regarding personal
1:31
life I have few Hobbies I love to play
1:33
football I love
1:35
reading as well and I love watching
1:39
science fiction movies
1:40
so they think that wraps up everything
1:42
about me okay okay so my next question
Long-term goals
1:46
is what are your long-term goals
1:50
uh my long-term goals would be to gain
1:53
as much experience as I can in my domain
1:55
that is additionally I plan on what I
1:58
learned using these initial formative
2:00
years from a uh for my next
2:03
few years which can help me move into a
2:06
more senior position so uh using
2:08
previous expense will help me so that
2:10
when opportunities come for promotions
2:12
or any other opportunities come then I
2:15
can make use of it if I use the correct
2:18
skills as such having a long-term Vision
2:21
in while starting out a career in
2:23
corporate can be very helpful so that
2:24
you can apply yourself in the right
2:26
direction and be aligned with that plan
2:28
I think that's my long-term goal as of
2:31
now at least okay good can you state the
Difference between Hard Work and Smart work
2:35
difference between hard work and smart
2:36
work
2:38
I really both are necessary in a person
2:41
one person needs to understand how when
2:43
to use Smart work and when to use hard
2:45
work uh but I think uh what really
2:48
differentiates is using less resources
2:50
and less time to achieve the same result
2:52
by putting more effort in high yielding
2:53
activities rather than
2:55
mindlessly slaving away I think that's
2:57
what makes the distinction between hard
2:59
work and smart work uh more prominent
3:02
it's like uh I think there's a quote by
3:04
Steve Jobs or some uh no I'm sorry that
3:06
that quote is from Bill Gates where he
3:07
said that I will find a lazy person to
3:09
do a difficult job because he'll find an
3:11
easy way to do it
3:13
so I think that pretty much sums it up
3:15
the difference between hard and smart
3:16
work okay good very good uh now let's
Technical Questions
3:19
start with the technical questions sure
3:21
first treat yourself in Java out of 10.
3:24
uh I think I rate myself for 6.5 out of
3:27
10 in Java
3:29
okay okay good now tell me what are jdk
What is JVM, JRE, and JDK?
3:32
jvm and JRE
3:34
please explain about them
3:37
sure let me go one by one first would be
3:40
the GDK which is the Java development
3:42
kit software package of jvm and Jr it
3:45
contains both it jdk basically provides
3:48
the standard edition of the Java
3:50
application programming interface
3:52
second was jvm which is the Java virtual
3:55
machine it's basically converts the
3:57
program into bytecode which basically
3:59
means it converts a user-friendly syntax
4:01
to machine language that the machine can
4:04
Java machine and The Interpreter can
4:06
understand okay
4:08
third one would be the JRE which is the
4:10
Java runtime environment and provides
4:12
the libraries and the resources for jdk
4:16
to execute the Java programs I think
4:17
that's the main distinction between
4:19
these three yeah right right so uh can
JAVA Pointers
4:22
you tell me does Java include pointers
4:25
um no Java does not include pointers can
4:27
you just please explain
4:29
okay so basically the first point of
4:31
pointers are the main benefit I would
4:33
say would be to uh for uh taking a
4:36
memory allocation purposes so Java
4:39
already has jvm like you mentioned
4:40
before so jvm automatically takes care
4:42
of memory allocation so there is no
4:44
real-time use case as such and when it
4:47
comes to a side benefits or pointers uh
4:49
like uh clearing memory because it just
4:53
points to a specific memory for clearing
4:55
memory Java also has this garbage
4:56
collector so all in all there is no
4:58
particular use case in majority of the
5:00
cases in Java where we would actually
5:02
require a pointer that is not something
5:04
already being done by Java right itself
5:06
okay so you are saying Java does not use
5:09
pointer in real time programming right
5:11
correct whatever all those benefits or
5:14
pointers that they offer in C Java takes
5:17
care of it on its own okay okay good uh
Java Time API
5:20
list some Java 8 date and time apis
5:22
I think the Three core apis would be the
5:24
local date local time and local date
5:27
time
5:28
okay
5:29
uh what is the default method and when
Default Method in java
5:32
does it get used the default method
5:36
actually involves an implementation and
5:38
it is found in an interface the method
5:40
adds new functionalities to an interface
5:42
while preserving backward compiler
5:44
backward compatibility with the classes
5:47
that have already implemented that
5:48
particular interface I think that's a
5:50
main purpose of our default method in
5:52
general
5:53
okay okay
5:54
uh okay can you mention the main classes
Classes Implementing List interface
5:57
implementing the list interface
6:00
first I think the most important will be
6:02
the linked list which basically linked
6:04
elements with no index and arraylist
6:07
which can be indexed then Vector which
6:10
is similar to array in some aspects and
6:13
it also can be indexed and the fourth
6:15
would be a stack stack which follows the
6:18
last in first dot methodology of the of
6:21
data structure
6:22
okay you just said array can you explain
What is an Array?
6:26
what is an array
6:28
array can be referred to as a collection
6:31
of items which are stored in a
6:32
continuous memory locations it's it must
6:35
contain items of the same data type when
6:37
it organizes data in a related set of
6:39
values that can easily be sorted
6:41
searched manipulated
6:44
Etc so basically it helps create a
6:46
collection of similarly uh defined
6:48
variables uh values in a single array
6:51
variable okay so we cannot store any
6:54
other data types in Array right yeah all
6:58
elements must be of the same data type
7:00
there cannot be any mix and match okay
7:02
okay good can you explain what is in
What is a Linked List?
7:04
linked list
7:06
it's kind of similar to array but it
7:09
refers to linear data structure in which
7:11
the elements are not necessarily stored
7:12
in a continuous manner like they are
7:14
stored in an array so it's basically a
7:16
sequence of nodes with each node
7:18
pointing towards the next node then
7:20
that's how it forms a chain-like
7:22
structure that's how it's different from
7:24
an array okay mention the link list
Linked list supported by java
7:28
supported by Java
7:29
a Java supports to a singly linked list
7:31
and W linked list single linked lists
7:33
where each node points to uh stores the
7:36
data and references to the next node
7:38
whereas the W linked list has points to
7:40
two different ones which is the one
7:41
before it and the one after it these are
7:44
the only two that are the job okay good
what is Recursion?
7:46
uh can you tell me what is regretation
7:49
what is recursion
7:51
you must have read about this
7:54
yes uh recursion would refer to a
7:56
function calling itself under a
7:58
particular terminating condition follows
8:00
the last in first out methodology and it
8:03
makes use of the stack uh data structure
8:07
okay now please tell me which sorting
8:11
algorithm is best according to you
Which sorting algorithm is the best?
8:14
uh I don't think any sorting algorithm
8:16
can be considered the best okay there
8:19
are many like bubble sort selection sort
8:21
balloons or Radix or all those things
8:22
are there but I don't think we can turn
8:24
any one of them as the best because they
8:25
all have different use cases if the if
8:28
there would have been a single best
8:29
sorting algorithm all of us would be
8:31
using only that one right so I don't
8:32
think there's particular best they are
8:34
fit for the specific type of data
8:36
structures where it performs the most
8:38
efficiently so no I don't think there is
8:40
particularly in my opinion I don't know
8:41
the best sorting algorithm okay right uh
What is the difference between systems.out, System.err, and System.in?
8:45
what is the difference between system
8:46
dot out system.e Double R and system.in
8:53
to error
8:56
can you just explain about it
8:59
yes uh system dot out and system.err
9:02
represent the monitor by default and
9:04
this can be used to send data or results
9:07
to the monitor so system.out
9:09
specifically is used to display normal
9:11
messages and results basically the print
9:13
function of the Java family
9:15
system.err is used to display the error
9:17
messages and setup.in third refers the
9:21
input string which uh is saying pushing
9:24
object actually which by default
9:25
represents standard input device which
9:28
in almost 99 of the cases is a keyboard
9:30
okay now can you write down the syntax
Syntax on how to create a linked list and a vector in Java?
9:35
on how to create a linked list and a
9:37
vector in Java you can just type it in
9:40
the chat box
9:42
uh sure
9:47
I'll actually create a new object okay
9:50
author linked list class here yeah
9:54
[Music]
10:01
I just want to see the logic only okay
10:03
okay
10:04
uh this is to create only the object
10:07
variable for the linked list I know
10:09
actually uh
10:11
[Music]
10:12
okay
10:22
[Music]
10:24
it's quite similar to the
10:26
link list object but we have to add two
10:29
more parameters which would be the size
10:31
and increment okay
10:36
let's type it here only I think I have
10:38
shared
10:40
okay
10:42
okay fine
10:44
so my next question is how do you get
How to find the highest number that exists in a list?
10:47
the highest number that exists on a list
10:49
just write a code here only okay should
10:53
I just put a sample uh yeah yeah I just
10:56
want to see the approach you are using
10:58
sure okay I'll just write the code again
11:00
highest number that exists on a list you
11:03
can take any random list
11:06
I'll create a list with integer
11:09
value
11:23
[Music]
11:26
foreign
11:57
foreign
12:15
list
12:16
okay
12:28
foreign
12:43
yes okay
12:49
I think that should be enough like
12:51
should I elaborate more or do you think
12:54
it's yeah it's fine it's fine I just
12:56
wanted to see the approach that you're
12:58
using okay now can you write how to do
How do you reverse a string in Java?
13:03
the reverse in string in Java
13:05
reversing a string right yeah okay
13:10
you can just take a string hello and
13:13
just reverse it okay I'll put it in a
13:16
variable
13:18
[Music]
13:23
I'll create a
13:25
dummy variable named reverse where the
13:29
actual reversed output will be stored
13:31
first I'll take the length of the string
13:37
and store it in the length variable like
13:41
I just shared next I'll start a for Loop
13:56
uh there's a single line in the body
13:58
I'll just
13:59
write that down separately okay
14:05
so you are taking basically it's taking
14:07
all the elements and it will keep adding
14:10
them to the
14:11
reverse variable that I had declared
14:13
before and the next step would be to
14:16
just print out the final reverse
14:19
variable
14:26
I think that will reverse the string
14:28
completely okay
14:32
okay fine
14:34
now
How many objects can a hashmap have?
14:36
how many objects will be inside the hash
14:38
map
14:41
um there can be two elements with the
14:43
same hash code but when two elements
14:46
have the same hash code Java uses the
14:48
equals to further differentiate so there
14:51
can be one or two objects depending on
14:53
the content of the objects
14:56
yeah okay okay now give an example how
how to create a HashMap
15:00
to create a hash map
15:02
in the chat only okay so like a sample
15:04
yeah
15:05
okay sure
15:08
I'll first import the necessary
15:10
libraries
15:17
this is the hashmap library then I will
15:21
report
15:24
the mapping Library
15:27
I'll start the main function okay
15:35
the class declaration
15:37
um now I would go with
15:44
[Music]
15:46
and now I'll start the body of the main
15:48
function
15:51
if you need time to just think of the
15:53
approach you can take time with this
15:55
which I thank you so much
15:59
um
15:59
I'll be putting two string values
16:10
declaring a new hash map right now
16:13
hmm
16:15
[Music]
16:20
[Music]
16:22
uh declare the new initialize the new
16:25
hash map then I'll start storing data in
16:28
these hashmaps
16:31
using the put function
16:41
this would be the first element and next
16:43
would be
16:46
similarly I'll put another element just
16:48
to show
17:00
okay you're taking the car names okay
17:11
so I've already just put two in the hash
17:15
map so now I can I can keep adding more
17:18
but I think if I just adding I can just
17:21
talk just add two or three only yeah so
17:24
these two are done so I can just print
17:27
out as
17:29
obj
17:33
and just basically close the main
17:35
function that's it
17:36
I think this will
17:39
okay just let me read once
17:56
it's good
17:57
okay can you please tell me what are
HR Interview Questions
18:00
your greatest strength and weaknesses
18:03
okay I'll start with my strengths I
18:06
think my ability to work well in a team
18:08
is one of my finest assets I have a
18:11
strong sense of self-motivation and I'm
18:13
a very quick learner
18:14
whatever assignment I get I usually uh I
18:17
tend to finish it very diligently and
18:19
preferably ahead of schedule
18:22
I don't know if there are any standout
18:24
weaknesses as such but one thing that I
18:26
believe can be improved about myself I'm
18:28
a people skills indulging in
18:30
conversation with co-workers and people
18:32
I'm not very comfortable with or talk
18:34
regularly with but I have been working
18:36
on that a lot and there has been a lot
18:38
of progress and there is going to be
18:40
more for sure moving on
18:42
I think that's the only thing that I can
18:44
count as a weakness okay good uh so
18:47
where do you see yourself in five years
18:51
okay uh I think initially I would first
18:54
uh like to grow my skills as a team
18:56
player in the first few years at any
18:59
organization uh then understanding how
19:01
upper level management works and then
19:03
ultimately uh get up earn a managerial
19:05
position
19:06
most likely handling a very high output
19:09
team and being able to Mentor a bright
19:11
group of people who who are prepping for
19:14
their next step in their career just
19:16
like I would have done by them
19:18
now tell me why should we hire you
19:22
uh have a very strong sense of
19:23
motivation I really push myself to
19:26
improve and learn more I am very
19:28
open-minded as well and I pick things up
19:30
rather quickly like to solve
19:32
difficulties and hopefully solve
19:33
roadblocks for our teammates come as me
19:35
okay apart from that from apart from
19:38
spills perspective additionally I
19:41
believe that the values of this
19:42
organization and mind are very
19:44
compatible so that's why I think I
19:46
believe that this job in this position
19:48
will support my interests and present me
19:50
with enough engaging and exciting
19:52
opportunities that will help me advance
19:54
myself and the company so that's why
19:58
frankly I'm very excited about this
19:59
chance okay okay good okay so thank you
20:04
baba this is all from my side if you
20:06
have any questions you can ask me
20:10
I think uh I really have only one
20:12
question uh can you tell me about a
20:14
company and the more importantly the
20:16
daily responsibility is that I'll be you
20:18
know asked to ahead on a day-to-day
20:19
basis okay so wherever right now I can't
20:22
tell you everything but we are a
20:24
software company we develop software
20:26
according to the needs of the clients
20:28
and everyone is Young and energetic here
20:31
so the environment is also very good
20:34
okay I think that's all I needed to know
20:37
okay okay thank you so much for your
20:40
interest
20:41
we'll let you know the results very soon
20:43
okay so thank you so much I will
20:45
definitely look forward to hearing
20:47
okay
